When I'm not working as a software developer or taking care of my family, girlfriend and two girls, I once in a while find time to build a RC model of the [Nasa Perseverance Mars rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/).

Every part is designed and created from scratch. All 3D-parts are modelled in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.dk/products/fusion-360).

This site is dedicated to document the build process[.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rgkXlf8cPuk7vK5TusMCs1gbg2yJ7uGyC3NX0Usd83k/edit?usp=sharing)

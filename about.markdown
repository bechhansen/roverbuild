When I'm not working as a software engineer or taking care of my family, girlfriend and two girls, I once in a while find time to build a RC model of the [Nasa Perseverance Mars rover](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/).

The project was started back in early 2021 as my Covid-19 isolation project.

Every part is designed and created from scratch. All the 3D-parts are modelled in [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.dk/products/fusion-360) and printed in PLA on my Creality Ender-3 V2 3D printer.

This site is dedicated to document the build process[.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rgkXlf8cPuk7vK5TusMCs1gbg2yJ7uGyC3NX0Usd83k/edit?usp=sharing)
